We live in a world thatâ€™s highly connected, full of smart devices and interactive digital experiences.  Yet emotions are missing from the digital world.  At Affectiva, we have made it our mission to bring emotional intelligence to the digital world. To make this mission a reality, we have created the Affdex SDK so that others can bring emotion-sensing and analytics to their own offerings, be it digital experiences, apps, games, devices, or other technologies.

Using our SDK, developers can now enrich digital experiences and apps with emotion-sensing and analytics.  Devices can now instantly respond to a user's unfiltered emotions, and apps can adjust their interfaces and flow to better suit moods. This makes for a more authentic, interactive, and unique experience.
