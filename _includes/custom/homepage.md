## Introducing the Affdex SDK

![]({{ "/images/banner.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

We live in a world that’s highly connected, full of smart devices, interactive digital experiences and artificial intelligence.  Yet emotions are missing from the digital world.  At Affectiva, we have made it our mission to bring emotional intelligence to the digital world. To make this mission a reality, we have created the Affdex SDK so that others can bring emotion-sensing and analytics to their own offerings, be it digital experiences, apps, games, devices, or other technologies.

Using our SDK, developers can now enrich digital experiences and apps with emotion-sensing and analytics.  Devices can now instantly respond to a user's unfiltered emotions, and apps can adjust their interfaces and flow to better suit moods. This makes for a more authentic, interactive, and unique experience.


**With the Affdex SDK you can:**

* [Locate and track]({{ site.baseurl }}/metrics#face-tracking-and-head-angle-estimation) human faces in an image.
* Measure and track facial expressions of [emotion]({{ site.baseurl }}/metrics#emotions) in realtime.
* Track 15 highly nuanced [facial expressions]({{ site.baseurl }}/metrics#facial-expressions) in real time.
* Recognize aspects of [physical appearance]({{ site.baseurl }}/metrics#appearance) such as person's gender and glasses.
* Identify 13 [emojis]({{ site.baseurl }}/metrics#emoji-expressions) from the posed facial images.

All processing is done on device -- no videos or images sent to our cloud.  

The SDK is available for [Android]({{ site.baseurl }}/android), [iOS]({{ site.baseurl }}/ios) and [Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/windows) platforms.

## About Affectiva’s Affdex Technology

The Affdex SDK is built on Affectiva's industry-leading [patented science](http://www.affectiva.com/technology). It’s designed to analyze spontaneous facial expressions that people show in their daily interactions. The highly accurate emotion recognition algorithms (classifiers) have been trained and tested using Affectiva’s massive emotion data repository - the world’s largest emotion database with more than 3.2 million faces from 75 countries analyzed, amounting to over 12 billion emotion data points. Designed for developer ease-of-use, processing of the emotion data is on-device (no cloud round trip), and the library is lightweight and fast to support a small memory footprint and real time processing.


We are excited that you are using our Affdex SDK. We are passionate about bringing emotional intelligence to the digital world, and look forward to seeing what amazing new apps and digital experiences you will emotion-enable using our technology.

We are always interested in promoting and marketing new solutions built with our SDK. Just send us a note at sdk@affectiva.com if you would like to share with us what you are working on.
