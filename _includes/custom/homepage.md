## Introducing the Affdex SDK
The Affdex emotion-sensing Software Development Kit (SDK) captures and reports facial expressions of emotion. These emotion insights can be obtained from an optical sensor (e.g. a web camera), a video or even an image.

By integrating the Affdex SDK developers can create interactive and exciting emotion-aware applications and digital experiences. As users interact with their mobile or desktop devices using applications and digital experiences you have built with the Affdex SDK, their facial expressions are captured, analyzed and made available for further processing.

Based on Affectiva’s highly accurate and patented science, the Affdex SDK provides unique and highly sophisticated emotion-sensing and analytics capabilities, yet provides emotion insights that are easy to interpret and process.

The Features of the Affdex SDK include:

* Captures facial expressions of emotion and feedback of emotion metrics in real time.
* Processes data obtained from optical sensors, such as a web camera, a video file, or still images.
* Supports tracking and analysis of multiple faces in frame.
* Has a flexible and easy to use API.
* Measures 7 emotions, 15 highly nuanced facial expressions, identifies presence or absence of glasses, and recognizes gender as well as 14 Emoji expressions.
* Has two alternative metrics for measuring the emotional experience: valence and engagement.
* All processing is done on device -- no videos or images sent to our cloud.

## Why Emotion-Enable Your Applications?

We live in a world that’s highly connected, full of incredibly smart devices and interactive digital experiences.  Yet emotions are missing from the digital world.  At Affectiva, we have made it our mission to bring emotional intelligence to the digital world. And to make this vision a reality, we have created our SDK so that others can bring emotion-sensing and analytics to their own offerings, be it digital experiences, apps, games, devices, or other technologies.

Using our SDK, developers can now enrich digital experiences and apps with emotion-sensing and analytics.  Devices can now instantly respond to a user's unfiltered emotions, and apps can adjust their interfaces and flow to better suit moods. This makes for a more authentic, interactive, and unique experience.

## Technology

The Affdex SDK is built on Affectiva's industry-leading patented science. It’s designed to analyze spontaneous facial expressions that people show in their daily interactions.  The highly accurate emotion recognition algorithms (classifiers) have been trained and tested using Affectiva’s massive emotion data repository - the world’s largest emotion database with more than 3.2 million faces from 75 countries analyzed, amounting to over 12 billion emotion data points. Designed for developer ease-of-use, processing of the emotion data is on-device (no cloud round trip), and the library is lightweight and fast to support a small memory footprint and real time processing.
