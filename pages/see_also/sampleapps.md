<h2> EmoSurvival </h2>

EmoSurvival is an emotion-enabled version of the "Nightmares" game from Unity's [survival shooter tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-project).  Our enhancements to the original "Nightmares" game cause it to pause when the player turns away (or covers the camera), and has the monsters interact with the player's character based on the player's emotional state.
