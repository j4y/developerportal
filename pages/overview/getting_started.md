## How to Use the SDK

### Live video feeds

The SDKs include classes to help extract emotion metrics directly from any optical sensor such as a web camera, including front and back facing cameras in the case of mobile devices.

### Recorded videos

A recorded video file that resides on the file system of the device can also be used as an input. The SDKs include support for opening all the major video formats.


### Photographs

The SDK also includes the capability to generate emotion metrics from individual images (photographs). 

## Supported Platforms

With the SDKs, developers can emotion-enable apps and digital experiences for [Android]({{ site.baseurl }}/android/), [iOS]({{ site.baseurl }}/ios/), [Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/windows/), [Unity]({{ site.baseurl }}/unity/).
