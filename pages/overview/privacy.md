Affdex takes the issue of privacy seriously, and we ask developers using the Affdex SDK to also be vigilant about safeguarding user information. The Affdex SDK collects a minimal set of anonymous technical data to help us better understand how it is being used.

* The Affdex SDK does not collect personal information
* The Affdex SDK does not store face video obtained from the device camera; all the processing is done local to the device, transiently, on a frame-by-frame basis.
* The Affdex SDK does not perform facial or identity recognition.
