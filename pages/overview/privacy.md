Affdex takes the issue of privacy seriously, and we ask developers using the Affdex SDK to also be vigilant about safeguarding user information. The Affdex SDK collects a minimal set of anonymous technical data to help us better understand how it is being used.

* The Affdex SDK does not collect personal information
* The Affdex SDK does not store face video obtained from the device camera; all the processing is done local to the device, transiently, on a frame-by-frame basis.
* The Affdex SDK does not perform facial or identity recognition.

## A Final Note

We are excited that you are using our Affdex SDK. We are passionate about bringing emotional intelligence to the digital world, and look forward to seeing what amazing new apps and digital experiences you will emotion-enable using our technology.

We are always interested in promoting and marketing new solutions built with our SDK. Just send us a note at sdk@affectiva.com if you would like to share with us what you are working on.
